# What are the benefits of using Object Oriented Programming in Ruby? 
# Think of as many as you can.

# It's a convenient way to model relationships
# It allows polymorphism - the same method can be implemented different ways
#   depending on where it's called
# It allows you to abstract implementation details away from where it isn't used
#   (encapsulation)
# It makes large code more readable and easier to maintain
