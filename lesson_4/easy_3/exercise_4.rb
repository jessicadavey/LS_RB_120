# How could we go about changing the to_s output on this method to look like this: 
# I am a tabby cat? (this is assuming that "tabby" is the type we passed 
# in during initialization).

class Cat
  def initialize(type)
    @type = type
  end
  
  def to_s
    "I am a #{@type} cat"
  end
end
# 

tabbi = Cat.new("tabby")

puts tabbi
