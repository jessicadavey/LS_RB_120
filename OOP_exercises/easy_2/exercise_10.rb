# We need a new class Noble that shows the title and name when walk is called:

byron = Noble.new("Byron", "Lord")
byron.walk
# => "Lord Byron struts forward"

# We must have access to both name and title because they are needed for other purposes that we aren't showing here.

p byron.name

p byron.title
# => "Lord"
